			<p>Jeroen van der Heijden has been passionate about programming since his early years,
                and has been actively contributing to the open-source world since 2012. He is the
                designer behind ThingsDB. His expertise extends beyond ThingsDB, as he is also the
                maintainer of other projects like SiriDB (a high-performance time-series database)
                and the "leri" language parsing libraries.</p>
			<p>Currently, Jeroen's expertise drives innovation at Cesbit, where he leads the development
                of InfraSonar (<a href="https://infrasonar.com">www.infrasonar.com</a>), a infrastructure
                monitoring solution that relies heavily on both ThingsDB and SiriDB.</p>
			<p>Beyond ThingsDB, he enjoys coding in C/C++, Python and other languages. When he's not
                coding, he spends time with his family or seeks thrills on the open road or trails
                with his race or mountain bike.</p>
