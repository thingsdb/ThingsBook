            <p>Like with learning any programming language, ThingsDB requires a setup to
                execute code examples. This setup includes at least one ThingsDB node,
                which acts as the interpreter responsible for executing the code. Throughout
                the first chapters of this book, we will primarily communicate with ThingsDB
                using the <em>"things-prompt"</em> application, a tool designed for running small
                code snippets. As we progress, we will delve into more practical examples
                and explore the realm of event-driven programming, showcasing the true power
                of ThingsDB when interacting with other programming languages. While this
                book includes some Python examples, you are free to choose a language that
                suits your preference, such as C#, Go or PHP. The provided examples are relatively
                straightforward to adapt to other programming languages.</p>
