            <p>The process running ThingsDB is called a node. ThingsDB is built to run across
                multiple nodes for avoiding downtime and scalability but for most chapters in
                this book, running a single node will suffice.</p>
            <p><strong>Exploring Multiple Nodes:</strong></p>
            <p>If you are interested in experimenting with distributed setups, you can run
                multiple ThingsDB nodes on your machine. However, this involves manually setting
                up each node with unique data paths and ports (covered in detail in <a href="ch15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>).
                Be aware that this process can be cumbersome.</p>
            <p><strong>Docker to the Rescue:</strong></p>
            <p>Docker offers a simpler and more efficient way to manage multiple ThingsDB nodes.
                Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their
                dependencies into self-contained units, ensuring consistent and portable
                environments.</p>
